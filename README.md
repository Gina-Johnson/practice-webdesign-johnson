For practice at NTS.

  My name is Gina Johnson and I am currently a senior in high school. I come from a large family with five siblings, making my daily life quite busy and exciting. I am also an avid pet lover and have a furry family of my own, including a dog, two cats, and two rats. When I'm not busy with school and taking care of my pets, I love to spend my free time drawing. I find it to be a relaxing and creative way to express myself, and it allows me to explore my artistic side. Additionally, my favorite color is green - it reminds me of the lush foliage and tranquility of nature.
  Drawing random characters is one of my favorite things to draw. I enjoy spending hours sketching and coloring them. While I love drawing characters from my favorite TV shows, I also enjoy creating my own characters. To do this, I sometimes will randomly choose colors and then build a character around that color scheme. It's exciting to see how each color influences the design of the character and how each color combination creates a unique personality for the character. When I draw, I usually use a cartoon style. Cartoon characters allow me to be more creative and experimental with my drawings. I love playing with the proportions of the character's body parts, experimenting with different facial expressions, and drawing different types of clothing and accessories. Drawing random characters is a fun and relaxing hobby that brings out my creativity and allows me to express myself in a unique way.
  I have several books on my bookshelf, and I really want to read more. Reading is one of my favorite hobbies, but lately, I have been struggling to motivate myself. However, once I find a book that truly captivates me, I become completely engrossed in it and cannot put it down.
