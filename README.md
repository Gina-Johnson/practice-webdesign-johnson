For practice at NTS.

  My name is Gina Johnson and I am currently a senior in high school. I come from a large family with five siblings, making my daily life quite busy and exciting. I am also an avid pet lover and have a furry family of my own, including a dog, two cats, and two rats. When I'm not busy with school and taking care of my pets, I love to spend my free time drawing. I find it to be a relaxing and creative way to express myself, and it allows me to explore my artistic side. Additionally, my favorite color is green - it reminds me of the lush foliage and tranquility of nature.
  Drawing random characters is one of my favorite things to draw. I enjoy spending hours sketching and coloring them. While I love drawing characters from my favorite TV shows, I also enjoy creating my own characters. To do this, I sometimes will randomly choose colors and then build a character around that color scheme. It's exciting to see how each color influences the design of the character and how each color combination creates a unique personality for the character. When I draw, I usually use a cartoon style. Cartoon characters allow me to be more creative and experimental with my drawings. I love playing with the proportions of the character's body parts, experimenting with different facial expressions, and drawing different types of clothing and accessories. Drawing random characters is a fun and relaxing hobby that brings out my creativity and allows me to express myself uniquely.
  On my bookshelf, I have an assortment of books that I have accumulated over time. Some I have read before and others are waiting for me to explore. Reading is a passion of mine, and I always look forward to unwinding with a good book after a long day. However, I have been struggling to find the motivation to read lately. Perhaps it's because of my busy schedule or because I haven't found a book that truly captivates me. But when I do find that one book that sparks my interest, it's as if the rest of the world ceases to exist. I get completely engrossed in the story and the characters, and I simply cannot put the book down until I reach the end. Reading is a joy that I don't want to let slip away, so I'm determined to find that next great read.
